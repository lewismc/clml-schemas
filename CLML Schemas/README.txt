Project Specifics

Data released under Legislation.gov.uk is published using open
standards and following all relevant recommendations of the
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). A choice of open standard formats
is available to maximise access and re-use; accessible HTML,
accessible PDF, XML and the recommended linked data format:
RDF. Legislative XML is published using an open XML schema: the Crown
Legislation Markup Language (CLML). This project is merely a
repository of those Schemas, which will be used within the 
mapping of Scottish Technical Standards to RDF/XML syntax for
use across the Semantic Web.

This software project is part of a larger effort to represent Scottish Technical 
Standards as new sets of rules. This would be to enable easier conversion of 
library data into RDF for usage in the semantic web.

In particular this project acts as a novel method for the drafting
of Scottish Technical Standards. Through use of client-side technologies
such as the Eclipse IDE [2], it is possible to create a more cohesive development
platform for professionals tasked with the drafting of Scottish Technical Standards.
This encourages increased collaboration between all stakeholders, in addition
to enabling a far greater potential for uptake by the public and professionals
working within the domain of sustainable design and construction alike. 

This methodology stems from the argument that the drafting of Legisaltion, including
Scottish Statutory Instruments such as Scottish Technical Standards should be 
carried out similar to the that of software development and that it should be tracked
through a source code management platform, where there is control 
over when content has been created/edited/authored/published etc.
